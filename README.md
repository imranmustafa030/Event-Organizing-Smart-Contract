# Event-Organizing-Smart-Contract

## Overview
The Event-Organizing-Smart-Contract is a Solidity-based smart contract developed using the Remix IDE. It enables event organizers to create and manage events by allowing customers to purchase tickets for the events and transfer them to their friends.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the smart contract, providing a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use the contract for event organization.

## Features
- **Event Creation**: Event organizers can create events by providing all the necessary information such as event name, date, location, ticket price, and other relevant details.
- **Ticket Purchase**: Customers can buy tickets for events by interacting with the smart contract. They can purchase multiple tickets for themselves and their friends.
- **Ticket Transfer**: After purchasing tickets, customers have the ability to transfer them to their friends by specifying the recipient's address. This feature allows for easy ticket sharing and distribution.

## Requirements
To use the Event-Organizing-Smart-Contract, you'll need the following:
- A compatible Ethereum network or a local development environment such as Ganache.
- Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/) or any other Solidity development environment.
- A web3 provider such as MetaMask for interacting with the contract in a web browser.

## Usage
Follow the steps below to set up and use the Event-Organizing-Smart-Contract:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/imranmustafa030/Event-Organizing-Smart-Contract.git
   ```

2. Open the Remix IDE (or your preferred Solidity development environment) and import the `EventOrganizer.sol` file from the cloned repository.

3. Compile the smart contract code and ensure there are no compilation errors.

4. Deploy the smart contract to your desired Ethereum network or local development environment. Make sure to specify the required constructor parameters such as the event organizer's address.

5. Interact with the deployed smart contract using the provided functions:
   - **createEvent**: Call this function to create a new event by providing all the necessary event details.
   - **buyTickets**: Use this function to purchase tickets for the desired event. Specify the number of tickets to buy and send the appropriate amount of Ether with the transaction.
   - **transferTickets**: After purchasing tickets, you can transfer them to your friends by providing their Ethereum addresses as recipients.
   - *(Optional)* Implement additional functions or modify the existing ones as per your requirements.

6. Use a web3 provider like MetaMask to interact with the smart contract in a web browser. Connect to the deployed contract address and execute the desired functions.

7. Monitor the event and ticket management by retrieving relevant data from the smart contract, such as the event details, ticket owners, and available ticket quantities.
